## 🧩 Process
   
1. Load Data: Import the dataset (CSV file) into Python.
2. Data Exploration (EDA): Explore the structure of the data, basic statistics , and relationships between variables.
3. Data Cleaning: Handle missing values and check and correct data types
4. Split Data for Training and Testing: Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
5. Build Linear Regression Model: Create and train the Linear Regression model using the training data.
6. Evaluate Model Performance: Using MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R-squared.
